# Design & Branding Portfolio — Minimal Theme

This is a responsive, accessible portfolio site in a white/grey/black, light, classic, minimal style.

## How to use
1. Unzip the download.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.
3. Replace images with your own (search `index.html` for the `img` tags).
4. Edit text directly in `index.html`.

## Deploy (free)
- **Netlify**: Drag-and-drop the folder onto app.netlify.com.
- **Vercel**: `Import Project` → select the folder.
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to a repo, then enable Pages on the `main` branch.

## Notes
- Typography uses Inter from Google Fonts.
- Layout uses fluid type (`clamp()`), CSS Grid, and a sticky header with subtle elevation.
- Mobile nav toggles to an accessible overlay menu under 640px.
- All sections are semantic and keyboard-friendly.
